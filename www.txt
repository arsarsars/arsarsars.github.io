Offset

Hello,

For points obtained by confirming receipt or product reviews, if a refund occurs subsequently, the points will be recalculated and the corresponding points will be deducted. If your current points balance is not enough to offset the deducted points, your points balance will be displayed as a negative number. This may come as a surprise, but don't worry.

The newly acquired points will also be used to balance this deficit first. When the deficit is completely offset, you will be able to freely use your points for shopping.

After verification, the points obtained for your old order (Order No.: XXXX) by (confirmation of receipt, product evaluation) have been used to pay for the new order (Order No.: XXXX), and then the old order (Order No.: XXXX) was refunded, which caused your points balance to show a negative number. I hope my explanation is helpful with a clear understanding of the points rules, and thank you for your support and understanding. I wish you a happy life!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regarding your concern about this matter, we see that you have placed an order with order number USO1M659U0000001EBX, and since this order needed 600 points for deducting the price amount, but since your points before is not enough for paying this order,

Therefore your points becomes minus and since your points has become minus, when you were getting a new points of 500 points, it is used to deduct the minus points, therefore you cannot see it at this time, since it has been used to make your points not a minus points any longer üôè 

I hope my explanation is helpful with a clear understanding of the points rules, and thank you for your support and understanding

After verification with the refund department, SHEIN has successfully initiated a refund for your order, and the refund amount is GBP 38.6 for item C.

Below is the proof that we have refunded to the platform/issuing bank for your reference.

Under normal circumstances, the refund time frame of this channel is 1-2 working days, but due to the complexity of cross-border transaction refund processing, the refund time frame for individual orders may be longer. The time you finally receive the refund depends on the processing efficiency of the platform and the issuing bank. Please wait patiently. If you have not received the refund after the expected refund time, you can contact the platform/issuing bank to inquire about the specific reasons.

Dear customer, thank you for your attention to the quality of our products and for reporting your issue. We take your feedback very seriously, but please understand, when processing such issues, we need detailed information or clear proof to verify the issue and provide the best solution.

Unfortunately, based on the information you have provided so far, we have not been able to locate the issue you've reported. We are unable to proceed at this time.

We are committed to ensuring customer satisfaction and providing the best service quality. If you can provide other effective materials, please feel free to contact us at any time.

----
Price higher


The problem you reported may be caused by the following two reasons: 

a. Your coupon has an upper discount limit. If the item in the shopping cart is not chosen, it does not exceed the discount upper limit; after the item and other items are chosen, the total amount exceeds the discount upper limit, the discount allocated to each item becomes smaller, and the corresponding amount becomes higher.

Please refer to the coupon below with a discount upper limit of GBP 10. When the total amount of items in the shopping cart is GBP 20, the discount amount = GBP 10. 

When the amount of items exceeds GBP 20 like GBP 50 or higher, the discount amount will not increase and will always be GBP 10. 

In this case, the more items checked in the shopping cart, the less discount each item will receive. 

b. If you have multiple coupons in your account, the price displayed when the item is not chosen is the price of the single item after using the best coupon. When you choose multiple items, the system will re-recommend the best coupon based on the total amount of the chosen items, so the amount of a single item will change.

Based on these two situations, it is recommended that you check the discount details of specific items in the shopping cart to verify the reasons for the price change.

----

We apologize for any inconvenience caused. Upon checking your order, we found that you used a coupon on this order. After returning the item, the order amount no longer meets the original coupon threshold, so we need to deduct GBP 11.68 back. Unfortunately, we are unable to compensate for this deducted amount, and we hope for your understanding.

The minimum value for using SHEIN coupons is based on the actual order value. The actual order value is your original order amount minus the refund amount (i.e., the original amount of the refunded item). The refund amount you receive will follow the policy below: (For more details, please refer to the official website link: https://www.shein.co.uk/Return-Policy-a-281.html?msockid=10d423c4952b6c372de3367894546dc3)

There may be two situations when applying for a refund after using this coupon: 

1) If the actual order amount still meets the original discount threshold for the coupon you used, the refund amount will not be adjusted.

2) If the actual order amount does not meet the original discount threshold for the coupon you used, the refund amount will be adjusted. The adjusted refund amount may result in a reduction in the amount we compensate you or even no refund at all.
